A very silly sound toy that takes audio input and converts it to a semi-random synth. designed to run on a Bela board.

When you press the button it records a sound. When you release the button it immediately replays that sound through a pitch detector, and through a synth.

The synth is semi-randomized. You only hear the sound once, and as soon as you press the button again the previous sound is erased permanently.
